title: 7 Key questions, to fit candidate into team
author: Ievgenii Vdovenko
role:  interviewer
overview: Aim of this questions is to build happy team. My believe is - if team is happy, it's more productive.
questions:
- question: Describe your vision of role you applied to.
  summary: very often candidate and company think differently about Role, so need sync up such detail; 
- question: Deal breakers, or what situation/environment will immediately trigger red flag in your head.
  summary: important information, because may be your env./team/etc. is bad for candidate, and could lead to future problems for you and candidate
- question: Evaluate yourself in {technology/language/etc.} in scale of 0-10
  summary: first ask self assigned mark, and then double check what this mean for candidate.   
- question: Cultural fit - this kinda not question, more action, before making decision need introduce candidate to team
  summary: doesnt matter how good candidate is, but if he/she can't work within specific team - it will be disaster  
- question: What makes you happy.
- question: What is your perfect day at work - what you would like todo, or not...
- question: Your biggest fail.
  summary: fails are more important that success, they could show how quick candidate learn, or if candidate do not do anything about their fails.
