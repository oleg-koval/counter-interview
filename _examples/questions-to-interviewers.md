questions:
- question: What's the process to get a book that I need to keep learning?
  summary: It's really important that this process is a simple one, it shows how much the company cares about you as a developer and wants to invest in you, getting a $50/100 book shouldn't be too complicated #[OPTIONAL FIELD]
- question: What's your working hour policy?
  summary: It might not be important for everyone but having flexible hours sounds like a must, even if you like working 9 to 5 it's always nice to see if company understands that not everyone might be an early morning guy.  #[OPTIONAL FIELD]
- question: What's the process from finishing a feature/bugfix to shipping to production?
  summary: This is a question to see if company has the mindset of continuous deployment, automated tests saving the team to have the "Don't deploy on fridays" mindset #[OPTIONAL FIELD]

  summary: This is a question to see WHO is responsible for continuous deployment, is it the developer, is it a Devops team setting the pipelines?  #[OPTIONAL FIELD]
