title: 8 Questions, to fit candidate into the team
author: Ievgenii Vdovenko
role:  interviewer
overview: The aim of these questions is to build a happy team. My belief is - if the team is happy, it's more productive.
questions:
- question: Describe your vision of the role you applied to.
  summary: very often candidate and company think differently about the role, so need sync up such detail; 
- question: Deal breakers, or what situation/environment will immediately trigger a red flag in your head.
  summary: important information, because maybe env./team/etc. is wrong for the candidate, and could lead to future problems for you and candidate.
- question: Evaluate yourself in {technology/language/etc.} in scale of 0-10
  summary: first ask self assigned mark, and then double check what this mean for candidate.   
- question: Cultural fit - this kinda not question, more action, before making decision need introduce candidate to team.
  summary: doesn't matter how good a candidate is, but if he/she can't work within a specific team - it will be a disaster  
- question: What makes you happy?
- question: What is your perfect day at work - what you would like to do, or not...
- question: What was your biggest failure?
  summary: fails are more important that success, they could show how quick candidate learn, or if candidate do not do anything about their fails.
- question: Have you had conflicts with your colleagues, and how you solved them?
