questions:
- question: Why do you like working here?
  summary: Of course, this question is only appropriate if you are being interviewed by someone you will be working with, but it can be a great chance to connect personally with the interviewer.
- question: How would you describe the companys culture?
  summary: Asking about the company emphasises your interest in working there and shows you are sociable.
- question: What do you think distinguishes this company from its competitors?
  summary: Showing an interest in the competition shows you are interested in the industry as a whole.
- question: What are the three most important skills youre looking for in an ideal candidate?
  summary: The answer to this question can give you some insight into whether youve shown those skills during the interview, while also giving you a chance to point out you have those skills.
- question: Who previously held this position? Where are they now?
  summary: Unless you know that the position you are applying for is brand new, this is a good question to find out more about what your potential future at the company may hold.
- question: Do you have any concerns about me or my qualifications in respect to this position?
  summary: While this is a rather bold move, asking whether the interviewer has any concerns about you may give you a chance to put some things straight and clear up any confusion about your skills or experience.
- question: What comes next at this stage?
  summary: Finding out what comes next can help you prepare for the next step – whether its knowing there will be another round of interviews or that you will have to wait at least a week before you get feedback. Dont be afraid to have your questions written down and get them out during the interview. It shows you came prepared!
